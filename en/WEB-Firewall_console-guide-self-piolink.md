1. Availability Zone: Configure the availability zone where the web firewall instance will be located. For more details on availability zones, refer to [the availability zone section in the instance overview.](https://docs.nhncloud.com/en/Compute/Instance/en/overview/#availability-zone)<br>
2. Instance Name: Configure the instance Name.<br>
3. Flavor: Configure the virtual hardware performance. Set the instance type by referring to the recommended specifications table for the web firewall below.<br>
4. Number of Instances: Set the number of instances to be created.<br>
5. Key Pair: Configure the key pair used for SSH access to the instance. You can either use an existing key pair or create a new one.<br>

| Throughput (Mbps) | Instance type | vCPU | Memory(GB) |
| :-------: | :-----: | :---: | :---: |
| 100 | m2.c2m4 | 2 | 4 | 
| 300 | r2.c2m8 | 2 | 8 |

1. Network Interface Settings
   * Create network interface: It is a method where the interface is automatically created in the selected subnet.
   * Specify existing network interface: This method involves selecting an already created interface. The settings for '2. Network' and '3. Floating IP' are omitted, as they follow the configuration of the existing interface.
2. Network: Select the subnet from the ones defined in the VPC to connect to the instance. PENTA WAF does not support additional interface configurations.
3. Floating IP: Specify whether to use a floating IP after the instance is created. At this time, the VPC to which the web firewall instance belongs must be connected to an internet gateway. Even if not configured now, it can be set later in 'Instance > Floating IP Management' or 'Network Interface > Floating IP Management', Etc.
4. Security Group: Select the security group to apply to the web firewall instance. Refer to the example settings below for guidance on configuring the security group.

<br>

| Direction | IP Protocol | Port | Remote(CIDR) | Description |
| :-------: | :-----: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| In | TCP | 80 (HTTP) | 0.0.0.0/0 | WAF Web Service Port |
| In | TCP | 443 (HTTPS) | 0.0.0.0/0 | WAF Web Service Port |
| In | TCP | 8443 | Admin IP | WAF Management Console(UI) Port(Allow Only Admin IP) |
| In | TCP | 22 (SSH) | Admin IP | WAF SSH Terminal Port(Allow Only Admin IP) |
| Out | ICMP | - | 0.0.0.0/0 | Communication for health check between the web firewall and web server |
| *Out | ALL | - | 0.0.0.0/0 | Communication with external servers for purposes such as external licenses, signature updates, etc. of the WAF |

<p align="center">[Table 2. Security Group Configuration Example]</p>

> [note]
> * Web firewall's default health check method is set to ICMP, and web service does not work when the web server and health check fail.
> * It is recommended to allow all outbound communication for the WAF *outbound rules as shown in [Table 2. Security Group Configuration Example].

[WEBFRONT-KS_KR_Initial-Setup-Guide.pdf](https://static.toastoven.net/prod_web_firewall/Piolink/Manual/WEBFRONT-KS_KR_Initial-Setup-Guide.pdf)
* After initial setup is complete, DNS needs to be changed to Web Firewall Floating IP so that protected domain traffic passes through the Web Firewall. 
* You should update Web Firewall PLOS version to the latest, referring to the release notes provided by the manufacturer. 
 * How to download release notes: Web Firewall Access > SYSTEM > General Settings > PLOS Management > Download PLOS > Download
