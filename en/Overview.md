## Benefits 

### Security Monitoring by Controlled Security Center 
- Equipped with full physical security control system (e.g. CCTV installed in all business areas, access control by fingerprint recognition, or magic mirror operations).
- Network divided for each work environment, control of information leakage and fortified pc security.
- Various dashboard screen configuration supported by audio and video equipment system, so as to detect and respond to real-time change of attacks.
- Service continuity ensured, and measures for interruptible power supply.

### 24/7 Cost-Efficient Professional Monitoring and Operation Services 
- Seasoned security personnel with sufficient experience in a variety of hacking threats promptly determine if it is an incident and its influences.
